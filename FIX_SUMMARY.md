# InfraLink Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The contract at `0x462e7F95b200F6f7B59cd62b7940D7Ac97E67f2F` was deployed with the old version of `devicecontract.sol` that doesn't properly detect Hedera networks. The new contract has been redeployed at `0xaff84326fc701dfb3c5881b2749dba27e9a98978` with the correct cross-chain functionality.

## Current Contract State
- **Network**: Hedera Testnet (Chain ID: 296)
- **Token Symbol**: ETH (❌ Should be HBAR)
- **Token Decimals**: 18 (❌ Should be 8 for HBAR)
- **Fee Per Second**: 1000000000000000 (0.001 ETH in 18-decimal format)
- **Expected Payment**: 600000000000000000 wei (0.6 ETH in 18-decimal format)
- **Actual Payment**: 60000000 tinybars (0.6 HBAR in 8-decimal format)

## The Issue
When you send 0.6 HBAR (60,000,000 tinybars), the contract expects 0.6 ETH (600,000,000,000,000,000 wei). This is a 10^10 difference!

## Solutions

### Option 1: Redeploy Contract (Recommended)
1. **Deploy with updated `devicecontract.sol`**:
   - The updated contract properly detects Hedera networks
   - Sets `tokenSymbol = "HBAR"` and `tokenDecimals = 8`
   - Use these deployment parameters for 0.001 HBAR/second:
     - `_feePerSecond = 100000` (0.001 HBAR in tinybars)
     - `_whitelistFeePerSecond = 50000` (0.0005 HBAR in tinybars)

2. **Update addresses in web app and Python monitor**

### Option 2: Use Correct Payment Amount (Temporary)
- Send 0.6 ETH equivalent = 600,000,000,000,000,000 wei
- This is 6 × 10^17 wei = 600 ETH (way too expensive!)

### Option 3: Deploy with Correct Fee (Temporary)
- Redeploy with `_feePerSecond = 100000` (for 0.001 HBAR/second)
- This will work with the current contract format

## Recommended Action
**Redeploy the contract** with the updated `devicecontract.sol` that includes:
- Proper Hedera network detection (Chain ID 296/295)
- Correct HBAR symbol and 8-decimal precision
- Appropriate error messages

## Frontend Fix Applied
- Fixed transaction success/failure handling
- Success message now waits for transaction confirmation
- Proper error handling for failed transactions
- No more disappearing success banners

## Files Updated
1. `devicecontract.sol` - Network detection and error messages
2. `DeviceDashboard.tsx` - Transaction handling
3. `debug_contract.py` - Contract debugging tool
4. `SETUP.md` - Troubleshooting guide

## Test Before Redeployment
Run `python debug_contract.py` to verify the new contract values match expected HBAR formatting.
