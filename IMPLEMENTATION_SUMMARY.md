- `src/components/UserProfile.tsx` - User profile management component
- `src/components/WhitelistManager.tsx` - Device whitelist management component
- `src/pages/UserProfilePage.tsx` - User profile page
- `USER_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive user guide for v2.0 features

### Files Modified:
- `devicelocal.py` - Added native token support and enhanced UI
- `src/components/DeviceDashboard.tsx` - Native token payment integration
- `src/components/DeviceScanner.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and chain detection
- `src/pages/DeviceOwner.tsx` - Added whitelist management interface

- `src/App.tsx` - Added profile page route
- `README.md` - Updated with v2.0 features and documentation

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Contract Deployment
1. **Deploy infralink-info.sol** to your target network
2. **Update contract addresses** in the following files:
   - `src/components/UserProfile.tsx` (line 46)
   - `src/components/WhitelistManager.tsx` (line 55)

### Environment Setup
```javascript
// In UserProfile.tsx and WhitelistManager.tsx
const INFRALINK_INFO_ADDRESS = "0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
```

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

### For Regular Users:
1. **Connect Wallet** → **Create Profile** → **Scan Device QR** → **Check Whitelist Status** → **Pay & Use Device**

### For Device Owners:
1. **Deploy Contracts** → **Register Device** → **Generate QR Code** → **Manage Whitelist** → **Monitor Usage**

## 🔐 Smart Contract Features

### DeviceAccess Contract (Enhanced):
- Native token support (`useNativeToken` flag)
- Enhanced `getDeviceInfo()` with payment type information
- Improved `activate()` function for both payment types
- Better event logging for native vs ERC20 payments

### InfraLink Info Contract (New):
- User profile management (name, bio, email, avatar)
- Device registration and information storage
- Centralized whitelist management with user profiles
- Admin controls for device and user management
- Cross-device access tracking for users

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Production:
- [ ] Deploy infralink-info.sol to target network
- [ ] Update contract addresses in UI components
- [ ] Test native token payments on testnet
- [ ] Verify user profile creation and management
- [ ] Test whitelist management functionality
- [ ] Validate error handling with wrong networks
- [ ] Test Python monitor with both payment types
- [ ] Verify QR code generation and scanning

### Integration Testing:
- [ ] Full user flow: profile → scan → pay → use device
- [ ] Device owner flow: deploy → register → manage whitelist
- [ ] Cross-device whitelist access checking
- [ ] Error scenarios: wrong network, insufficient funds, invalid contracts

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Smart Contracts:**
   ```bash
   # Deploy infralink-info.sol first
   # Deploy device contracts with useNativeToken parameter
   # Note deployed addresses
   ```

2. **Web Application:**
   ```bash
   # Update contract addresses in components
   # Build and deploy
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Python Monitor:**
   ```bash
   # Update RPC URLs and contract addresses
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python devicelocal.py
   ```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements Ready
- Multi-chain support (contract addresses per chain)
- Advanced analytics integration
- Mobile app with same component structure
- Subscription models using the whitelist system
- Device categories and discovery features

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy:
```
App
├── Index (Main page with profile link)
├── UserProfilePage (Profile management)
├── DeviceOwner (QR + Whitelist management)
└── DeviceDashboard (Enhanced with native token support)
```

### Contract Integration:
```
InfraLink Info Contract ←→ User Profiles & Device Registry
       ↕
DeviceAccess Contracts ←→ Payment & Access Control
       ↕
Python Monitor ←→ Hardware Control
```

### Payment Flow:
```
User Input → Contract Detection → Payment Type Check → 
  ├── ERC20: Approval → Transfer
  └── Native: Direct ETH Transfer
```

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Central user profile system implemented
- ✅ Native token payments fully supported
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with network detection
- ✅ Device whitelist management through web interface
- ✅ User can see all device access across platform
- ✅ Device owners can manage whitelist with user profiles
- ✅ No new technologies added (React, Python, Solidity stack maintained)
- ✅ Backward compatibility preserved
- ✅ Enhanced documentation and user guides

---

**InfraLink v2.0** is ready for deployment with comprehensive user profile management, native token support, and enhanced user experience! 🚀
