# Recent Devices Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the recent devices feature that allows users to store and quickly access their last few connected devices from the homepage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Components

#### **useRecentDevices Hook** (`src/hooks/useRecentDevices.ts`)
- Manages recent devices storage in localStorage per user
- Tracks up to 5 recent devices
- Provides functions to add, remove, and clear recent devices
- Automatically saves/loads data based on connected wallet address

#### **RecentDevices Component** (`src/components/RecentDevices.tsx`)
- Displays recent devices in a clean, organized card layout
- Shows device name, description, and whitelist status
- Includes "Connect" button for quick reconnection
- Provides individual remove buttons and clear all functionality
- Shows relative time since last connection (e.g., "2h ago")

#### **Homepage Integration** (`src/pages/Index.tsx`)
- Added RecentDevices component to the homepage
- Positioned prominently at the top when users are logged in
- Integrates seamlessly with existing UI flow

#### **DeviceDashboard Tracking** (`src/components/DeviceDashboard.tsx`)
- Added useRecentDevices hook integration
- Automatically tracks devices when successfully connected
- Includes device name, description, and whitelist status
- Updates recent devices list when device data is loaded

### 2. Backend/Contract Updates

#### **Python Device Monitor** (`devicelocal.py`)
- Added INFO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS constant for whitelist logic
- Updated to use the new contract address (0xaff84326fc701dfb3c5881b2749dba27e9a98978)
- Prepared for Info contract integration for enhanced whitelist functionality

#### **Contract Configuration** (`src/lib/contracts.ts`)
- Centralized contract addresses and ABIs
- Added RecentDevice type definition
- Updated contract addresses to production values

## Key Features

### 1. **User-Specific Storage**
- Each user's recent devices are stored separately using their wallet address
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Maximum of 5 devices per user to keep the list manageable

### 2. **Smart Device Tracking**
- Devices are automatically added when successfully connected
- Most recent devices appear first
- Duplicates are prevented (updates timestamp instead)
- Includes whitelist status and custom names

### 3. **Quick Reconnection**
- One-click reconnection to previously used devices
- Maintains device context (name, description, whitelist status)
- Seamless integration with existing device connection flow

### 4. **Clean UI/UX**
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Clear visual indicators for whitelisted devices
- Intuitive time-based sorting
- Easy device management (remove individual or clear all)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface RecentDevice {
  address: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  lastConnected: number;
  isWhitelisted?: boolean;
  whitelistName?: string;
}
```

### Storage Strategy
- Uses localStorage with user-specific keys
- Format: `infralink-recent-devices-{userAddress}`
- Automatic cleanup of old entries
- Graceful handling of corrupted data

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when localStorage is unavailable
- Safe JSON parsing with error recovery
- Non-blocking if recent devices feature fails

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can quickly reconnect to frequently used devices
2. **Reduced Friction**: No need to scan QR codes or enter addresses repeatedly
3. **Smart Defaults**: Automatically tracks devices without user intervention
4. **Persistent State**: Remembers devices across sessions
5. **Privacy-Focused**: Data stored locally, not on servers

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on the recent devices workflow
2. **Analytics**: Track usage patterns to optimize the feature
3. **Cross-Chain Support**: Ensure compatibility with all supported networks
4. **Advanced Features**: Consider adding device favorites or categories
